Kaboooom Source

Source musings:
- Kaboooom was a port of code written in C and published in Dr Dobbs back in 1989.
  Original port was done in Turbo pascal (text mode) with the OS/2 port created
  in Sibyl.
- There is still a bug that I haven't tracked down completely in the computer
  analysis of your position.  This bug leaves the analysis in an endless loop.  It
  can be broken out of by pressing the cancel button.  The bug was evident in the
  original C source.
- Have fun with the source...
